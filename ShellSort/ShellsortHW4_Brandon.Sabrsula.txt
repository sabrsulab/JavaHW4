The shell sort appears to be operating as intended. It breaks down the array into smaller sub-arrays (each sub-array is
sorted by every 3rd item in the whole array; array[0], array[3], array[6], array[9] would be in one of the sub-arrays sorted
next to each other in the first intermediate step, for example). Then, by the conclusione of the second, complete pass of 
the shell sort, the whole array would be sorted.
